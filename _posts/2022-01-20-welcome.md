Welcome folks!

This website is a place for the development of M68k supports in LLVM. Including code generation, assembler, Clang support, and other target-specific LLVM components.

The M68k LLVM target as well as this website are both under heavy development. Code contributions are very welcome, please follow the standard [LLVM contribution guidance](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html) if you're interested in working on the LLVM part. For this website, feel free to [drop a PR](https://github.com/m680x0/m680x0.github.io) to make some changes.

Alternatively, you can support us with donations. Please checkout [this page](/donation) for available options.

Thank you for your interests and supports on this project :-)
