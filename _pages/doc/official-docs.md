## M68000 Family Programmer's Reference Manual
The go-to documents for learning M68k instruction set.
  - [PDF](/ref/M68000PM_AD_Rev_1_Programmers_Reference_Manual_1992.pdf)
  - [HTML version](/ref/M68000PM_AD_Rev_1_Programmers_Reference_Manual_1992.html) converted from the PDF via [pdf2htmlEX](https://pdf2htmlex.github.io/pdf2htmlEX)

Note that the PDF, as well as the HTML version, don't have bookmarks to individual instructions' pages in Section 4 (Integer Instructions), 5 (Floating Point Instructions), 6 (Supervisor Instructions), and 7 (CPU32 Instructions) making navigations between different instructions more difficult. Thus, I created separate online pages for those sections with detailed outline on the side. 
  - [Section 4. Integer Instructions](/ref/integer-instructions.html)
  - [Section 5. Floating Point Instructions](/ref/floating-point-instructions.html)
  - [Section 6. Supervisor Instructions](/ref/supervisor-instructions.html)
  - [Section 7. CPU32 Instructions](/ref/cpu32-instructions.html)
